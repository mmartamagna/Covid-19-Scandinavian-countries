# Difference-in-Differences to identify the causal effect of NPIs during Covid-19: evidence from Denmark and Sweden

During the first wave of Covid-19, not all European countries adopted the same restrictive strategies
and policies. An interesting case is the one regarding Sweden, which decided to not impose severe
confinement measures and to rely on community trust and individual decision-making. Conversely,
confining Scandinavian countries such as Denmark immediately introduced severe non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) to tackle the emergency. In this project, we exploit policy variation between Denmark
and Sweden to investigate the causal effect of introducing NPIs, namely workplace closing and gatherings
restrictions, on the 7-day moving average of deaths and cases. Our Difference-in-Differences (DiD) models
provide evidence that during the first Covid-19 wave such policies have been significantly effective and
persistent over time in curtailing the curve of deaths and cases in Denmark, as compared to the Swedish
situation.

### 3. Model estimation (DiD)

The purpose of the article is thus to apply a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework to estimate the causal
effect of NPIs (especially workplace closing and gatherings restrictions), which took place in Denmark but
not in Sweden, on the 7-day moving average of daily Covid-19 deaths and cases, normalized per million
population. In particular, the period considered covers February 26 - June 3, 2020, which comprehends the
first wave of Covid-19 in Scandinavia. The DiD approach has been chosen because it “makes use of naturally
occurring phenomena or policy changes that may induce some form of randomization across individuals in
the eligibility of the assignment to the treatment” (Blundell et al., 2009). In this setting, the job places
closing and gathering restrictions contribute to naturally creating a reasonable control group (Sweden) and
a reasonable treatment group (Denmark) through which it is possible to evaluate the efficacy of the policy.
We found evidence that such policies were significantly effective in curbing down the curve of deaths and
cases in Denmark, as compared to the Swedish situation. Moreover, we found such effects to be particularly
persistent over time.
